## Hand-in
You can either hand in via mail or by showing your solution to the instructors.

If you attend the class (and we suggest you do), you can demo your solution to the instructors up until 15.45.
Apart from the approval of your hand-in, this will give you attendance points as in regular classes.

If you hand in via mail, you can get the additional "att endance point" if your score is THREE our above
and you have completed either 4 or 5. The mail should be sent to ``iwantstudypoints@gmail.com``, have a
topic called `Study point exercises 1`` and _must_ include either a link to a git repository (GitHub,
Bitbucket or whatever) containing all the code for the exercises.
Please make sure that we can access the repository before you hand it in.

### When to hand in
If you hand in via mail, send a mail as described below no later than Friday, 
February 3rd, 15.00. 
If you hand in to the instructors in the class, you can demo until 15:45.

These deadlines are hard. The tutors are paid until 16.00 and are not expected to continue after that.
