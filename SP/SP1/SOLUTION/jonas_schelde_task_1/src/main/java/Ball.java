     * Execute the main method in ex3.BallDemo.java. There is a problem here. Can you find it?

     * Solve the problem by rewriting the Ball class to extend `Thread, so that
     * 1) the balls can be started / stopped asynchronously and
     * 2) the program can be terminated by pressing the cross.
