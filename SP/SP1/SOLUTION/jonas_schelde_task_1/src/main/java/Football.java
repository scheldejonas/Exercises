     * Use the code in the package ex4 as start code for this exercise. This program simulates a
     * large football stadium with many turnstiles that each updates a shared counter, for each
     * spectator that passes a turnstile.
     *
     * Initially, the code is set up to simulate 40 turnstiles, each (running in a separate thread)
     * simulates that 1000 spectators pases.
     *
     * Execute the code and observe the reslult of the shared counter.
     *
     * If the result is not as expected, solve the problem:
     * 1) Using the traditional synchronization
     * 2) Using a AtomicInteger
     * 3) Using a java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock
