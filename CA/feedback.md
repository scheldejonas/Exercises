# CA feedback

Your tutors will look through the assignments and give you feedback based on the following:

## Requirements
Are all the requirements for the CA met?

This will be evaluated againts the entire project material.

* How many of the requirements in the CA did you meet?
* Did you correctly understand and execute these requirements?

Example: In CA1 did the group correctly implement the chat protocol?

## Participation
How well did the group handle the task?

This will be evaluated against the documentation of the project and the commit log of the project.

* Did each individual contribute?
* Did each individual contribute equally?
* Did all the group members participate in both coding and documentation?

Example: Did all the group members both code _and_ document?

## Architecture
How well is the software architected?

This will be evaluated againts the documentation and code.

* Did the group implement design patterns?
* Did the group think about the future use and extendability?
* Did the group correctly separate the concerns of the different elements in the CA?

Example: In CA1 did the group correctly separate the console based client from the
GUI based client? And did you use any patterns to do it?

## Code, tests and documentation quality
What is the quality of the code and documentation?

This will be evaluated againts the documentation, code and tests.

* How much of the project is tested (coverage)?
* What is the quality of the code?
  - Is it correctly indented?
  - Are variables named sensibly?
  - Are the classes correctly named and no longer than ~200-300 lines of code?
* Is the documentation adequate to describe all of the system?
  - Are there any 'blind spots' in the documentation?
  - Is something conveniently omitted?
